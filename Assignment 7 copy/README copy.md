Cameron:

The website I'm thinking of would be way out of the realm of possibility for me,but I can think of a way to dumb it down and make it somewhat possible for me. It would be one where a user could post a block of text offering a job. Any other user could come to the site, see that post, and then click a button by that post which would show them the poster's email so thy could contact them.

If I were to break down the site into individual parts to code,there would be one part that would be 2 text boxes, one for the post and one for the email. Next would be a button to submit those text boxes, the first box would be posted onto the webpage so others could see it, and the other would be added o the next button. This next button would appear beside the text box, and when clicked it would display the email of the user who posted.

Patrick:

Once we get into weeks 8 and 9, this should be really doable. If you drop the idea of users to start, instead just having email address be a field on the "jobs" table, things get simpler. You'd probably only need database tables for "jobs" and "applications".
